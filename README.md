systemInfo
==========

A cross-platform header file to get hardware information about a computer.

How to use
==========
Include the file in one of your project files, and call any of the functions!
The functions will return a std::string of the info. Up to you how you then want to format it.

This library requires C++ 89 or higher, for compatiability , I didnot used CXX11 or higher features.

Progress
========
Linux info is pretty much done. But API availRAM is not completed yet , added by DCZYewen.
Windows info is fully done by Gemini K. Fraustino at [DCZYewen](https://github.com/DCZYewen).
OSX hasn't been started, as I don't have an OSX machine to test on.
